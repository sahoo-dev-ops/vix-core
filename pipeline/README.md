# VIX Pipeline

This folder defines how vehicle data flows through the VIX system.

Pipeline stages:
1. Input ingestion (raw vehicle data)
2. Signal extraction (from signals/)
3. Risk & value calculation
4. Decision evaluation (rules/)
5. Final response output

This is the backbone of the VIX engine.
